# Pycman Package Development
Package to train and eveluate an AI in ATARI environments in which observations are pixel values (does not support RAM version of OpenAI Gym games). 

Serpentine is a student-founded AI E-Sports team based at the Technical University of Eindhoven. Take a look at our website for more information on Serpentine, who we are and what we do! You can find us at [www.serpentineai.nl](https://www.serpentineai.nl "Serpentine's Homepage").

# Getting started
You can run the unit tests to see if your install has been successful. Run _pycman/main_gui.py_ to load the GUI and get started. The algorithms class is the class to inherit if you want to construct custom algorithms to train and run.
