# Pycman Package Development
A package aimed at standardising the development and evaluation of AI algorithms. 

Supports running of multiple agents,
logging and visualization of results and comparing against famous baseline research. OpenAI Gym is supported as a 
training environment. It is also possible to implement wrappers to custom environments when needed.

# Getting started
The unit tests can be run te see if your installation has been successful. Take a look at the examples folder
to see implementations of agents and how they interface with __pycman__. Good luck!
