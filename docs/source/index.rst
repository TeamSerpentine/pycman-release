A short introduction about the creating team.


Team Serpentine
***************

    We are an AI E-Sports team. We focus on developing tools and algorithms to
    compete in E-Sports competitions using AI. Based in Eindhoven, the team mainly
    consists of students at the Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e). To put the spirit

    of the team in the words of our founding chairman:

    “At the moment our main objective is participating and winning the FruitPunch.ai
    competition, which will take place during the second semester of 2018/2019. With the
    use of our shortl educational program and our guidance, new members will quickly be
    able to take on development tasks for our state of the art. We value the contributions of

    our members and we work together in an open atmosphere.”

    – Wouter van den Bemd, 2018

    and ourselves.
    Training and Teaching

    By accommodating sufficient resources to training and mentoring, we strive to
    maximize long term health and growth of our team and community.

    By pushing ourselves in a competitive environment and facilitate accountability of our
    actions, we strive to achieve the highest standard of quality and efficiency.
